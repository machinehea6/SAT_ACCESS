Objective: Pull images from NOAA satellites orbiting Earth. 
Satellites: NOAA-15,18,19
Sat tracking: https://www.n2yo.com/
Steps: 
- Identify broadcast frequency 
- Design antenna for reception 
- Acquire compatible SDR 
- Identify software suite
- Identify period of orbit and windows of access for the satellites. 

Broadcast frequencies: 
- 137.9125 MHz (NOAA 18)
- 137.100 MHz (NOAA 19)
- 137.620 MHz (NOAA 15)

Antenna Design: 
- Dipole design: 
	Pros:
	+ Easy
	+ Cheap
	+ Polarization neutralizes terrestrial frequencies.
	Cons:
	- Potentially less receptive 
	- Minor loss (1Db)

- Helical design: 
	Pros: 
	+ Highly receptive
	+ Potentially more widely applicable
	+ Interesting project
	+ Currently have many supplies
	Cons: 
	- More terrestrial interference 
	- More finicky
